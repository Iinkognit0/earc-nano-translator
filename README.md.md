# eArc Nano Translator

Minimal open-source proof-of-concept for **eArc**.

This repository contains a **frames-first architecture** with:
- deterministic local storage
- a nano translator (Python)
- passive RSS ingest
- no execution
- no push
- no tracking

Meaning before interface.  
Structure before features.  
Longevity over speed.

## What this is

This is **not an app**.  
This is **not a platform**.  
This is a **kernel-adjacent proof-of-concept**.

The system works with **Frames**:
small, atomic, machine-readable units of meaning.

Human-readable output is produced **only by translators**.

---

## Core Principles

- Frames are the source of truth
- Translators are optional
- No auto-run
- No auto-send
- No background execution
- Read-first, append-only

Silence is a valid state.
